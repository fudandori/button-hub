# Button Hub (Angular component)
 Angular component that consists in a container that holds a N number of button components. These buttons have both active and inactive mode, which changes whenever the user hovers the mouse over them. In inactive mode only the icon of the button is showed, while in active mode, both the icon and text are shown.

The transition from active or inactive comes with a smooth animation where the button's length grow over time until reaching the full size to host the description text.

The buttons are powered by the Angular [Clarity Design System](https://clarity.design/) Framework
